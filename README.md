## "Opquast RSS" for Panic's Status Board

If you are a web developer, i hope you are aware of [Opquast best practices](http://opquast.com/en/) for websites. 

As the [Twitter of Opquast](https://twitter.com/opquast) does it regulary, it should be good to display them one by one on your Panic's statusboard.

So i have generated two RSS files ( _FR / EN_ ) of the best practices, to display them in an RSS Widget, in ticker mode.

### Install
Currently, it's not possible to install a RSS widget from a link, so copy/paste the url you want in your RSS Widget configuration:

* **[EN]** `http://cvergne.github.io/opquast_statusboard/opquast_widget/rss/opquast-list-en.rss`
* **[FR]** `http://cvergne.github.io/opquast_statusboard/opquast_widget/rss/opquast-list-fr.rss`

### Preview
You should have something like :
`#10 - Content - Information in regard to the right to copy and reuse are available from all pages`  
Then you can "touch" to go to the criterion sheet in Safari.
